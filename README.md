I'm malarada, more commonly known as Pyro Cyclone. I do silly little projects for all kinds of different things, kinda just whatever I feel. 
Not exactly sure why my name is malarada, kinda just logged in one day and it was that. I honestly didn't know this account existed before then.
If you wanna reach out, I am most available on Discord. An invite to my studio server is around here somewhere, you might have to search.
Github gives me a list of ideas so here we go:
* 🔭Working on: just random crap I think is interesting.
* 🌱Learning: not sure rn. I think I'm trying to learn something but I can't put a pin in it.
* 👯Looking to collaborate on: nothing right now. But if you have an interesting idea for a project, reach out and I'll ponder it.
* 🤔Looking for help with: nothing at the moment, I kinda just go to the random Discord servers I'm in to ask questions.
* 💬Ask me about: whatever you want. I probably don't have any projects you'll find interesting but that's more up to you.
* 📫How to reach me: mostly Discord, but I also have an email if you really think you need it. That should also be around here somewhere.
* 😄Pronouns: doesn't matter to me, but I am biologically a he/him. I've even been called a she as a joke.
* ⚡Fun fact: did you know pigeons lactate? Not completely sure why that's my favorite fact but sure. Seals also lactate, it just goes all over their skin.
